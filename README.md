### Micro forms

Nicro forms is inspired from Nano forms. It aims to help people with low level of programming skills to create forms and deploy their websites.

This one is slightly more complex from Nano forms. At some point your javascript code is going to be more complex and you will need to import file, json and probably want to test some fonctions.

This is where TypeScript, Jest and Esbuild are going to help you.
